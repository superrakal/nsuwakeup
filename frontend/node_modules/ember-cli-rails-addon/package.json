  "readme": "# EmberCLI Rails Addon\n\nThis is an integration piece between\n[ember-cli-rails](https://github.com/rwz/ember-cli-rails/pull/25/files) (the\nrubygem) and the EmberCLI applications they reference.  This addon is\nresponsible for the following\n\n- Setting expected build variables without the user having to manipulate their\n  EmberCLI app's `Brocfile`\n- Creating lockfiles that `ember-cli-rails` tracks to ensure that requests halt\n  until EmberCLI has had a chance to fully build\n- Write build errors to a file so that `ember-cli-rails` can display them\n  properly\n- Exposes `dist/index.html` to Rails' asset pipeline in order to survive the\n  cleanup after `rake assets:clean`\n- Disabled [Subresource Integrity][SRI], since the asset pipeline URLs no longer\n  match the URLs the SRI hashes were generated against.\n\n[SRI]: https://github.com/jonathanKingston/ember-cli-sri#what-is-it\n",
